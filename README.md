# Frequent-flyer-cluster
The file EastWestAirlinesCluster.csv contains information on 3999 passengers who belong to an airlineâ€™s frequent flier program. For each passenger, the data include information on their mileage history and on different airways they accrued or spent miles in the last year. The goal is to try to identify clusters of passengers that have similar characteristics for the purpose of targeting different segments for different types of mileage offers.
